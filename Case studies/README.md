# Case studies

Data used for the experiments.

### Swaggers

The folder `Swaggers` contains the Swagger files we used for our experiments. The set has been already filtered from APIs which required authentication and not responding APIs.

### Nominal-Tester

Statistics on results are reported in the files **results_after_filters_0409.csv** and **results_after_filters_0409.ods**.

The file **experiments_results.tar.gz** contains the RESTTESTGEN output for each of the input APIs.

### Error Tester

The folder `error-tester/services` contains, for each API, the result of the tool *error-tester* applied on the nominal-tester output reports.
